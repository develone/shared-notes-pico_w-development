In my network in El Paso I have a pi4-37, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ wih a 7in. display, 
the IP is 192.168.1.231.

In Alamo pi4-37 which is a pi400 has a different IP 192.168.0.25

The model being used between the various pico_w is subscriber/publisher.

Developed by IBM in 1999, MQTT, or MQ Telemetry Transport, is the lightweight 
messaging protocol that enables communication between remote devices, 
such as smartphones and web apps, sensors, and other systems. 

In addition, one can see examples of successful MQTT implementation in 
many industries â€” automotive, logistics, manufacturing, smart home, consumer 
products, transportation, and many others.

To perform data transfer between devices, MQTT runs over TCP/IP network protocol
and uses the publish-subscribe pattern to send out messages. However, there is 
much more to it than that. Keep reading this article to understand how to 
establish the MQTT connection, learn more about the CONNECT and CONNACK 
data packets, and what roles a client and a broker play in this process. 

To start the broker on pi4-37 the command ./scripts-rpi/mosquitto/mos.sh

devel@pi4-37:~ $ ./scripts-rpi/mosquitto/mos.sh 
1694166200: mosquitto version 2.0.11 starting
1694166200: Config loaded from /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf.
1694166200: Opening ipv4 listen socket on port 1883.
1694166200: Opening ipv6 listen socket on port 1883.
1694166200: mosquitto version 2.0.11 running

If a pico_w was programmedd correctly it would connect with the broker 
as shown below. 
devel@pi4-37:~ $ 1694166299: New connection from 192.168.32.106:53281 on port 1883.
1694166299: New client connected from 192.168.32.106:53281 as remote5 (p2, c1, k10, u'testuser').

A 2nd command that is used to sse which pico_w are connected is
devel@pi4-37:~ $ ./scripts-rpi/mosquitto/mos-q.sh 
Onboard temperature = 34.16 C remote5 
Onboard temperature = 34.16 C remote5 
Onboard temperature = 34.16 C remote5 
Onboard temperature = 34.16 C remote5 

Note the difference when the command are run on pi4-3 which has 3 remotes.

1694168057: mosquitto version 2.0.11 starting
