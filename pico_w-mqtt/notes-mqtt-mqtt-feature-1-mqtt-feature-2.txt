To demo the mqtt-feature1 & mqtt-feature2
The broker is running on pi4-37
In addition the querry is running on pi4-37
mqtt-feature1 the temperature is being displayed in C
pi4-50 request a change to F
mqtt-feature2 the temperature is being displayed in F
pi4-50 request a change to C
The pico_w can be controlled from any system that is on the same network as the broker.
In this example pi4-50 192.168.1.212 and pi4-37 192.168.1.231.
While the pico_w is on WIFI Century Link6
